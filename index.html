				<p id="title-text">the lolicon debate</p>
				<p class="text-margin">In Japanese popular culture, lolicon is a genre of fictional media in which young girl characters appear in romantic or sexual contexts. The term, a portmanteau of the English words "Lolita" and "complex", also refers to desire and affection for such characters, and fans of such characters and works.</p>

					<p>The rise of lolicon as a genre began at Comiket, a convention for the sale of dōjinshi (self-published works) founded in 1975 by the group Meikyu, made of adult male fans of shōjo manga; in 1979, a group of male artists published the first issue of the fanzine Cybele, whose standout work was an erotic parody of Little Red Riding Hood by Hideo Azuma, known as a pioneer of lolicon.</p>
					<p>Lolicon manga played a role in attracting male fans to Comiket, an event originally dominated by women (90 percent of participants were female at its first run in 1975); in 1981, the number of male and female participants was equal.</p>

					<p>The exclusion of lolicon from the 2014 amendment to Japan's child pornography laws was justified by an LDP lawmaker stating that it does not directly violate the rights of children or cause harm, and there is no scientific validation to suggest that it indirectly causes damage. Some activists support this argument, stating statistical data that shows the prevalence of fictional lolicon has increased while the sexual abuse of minors in Japan has declined since the 1960s and 1970s. Some scholars argue that lolicon imagery does not necessarily influence crimes and that it represents a "third gender" rather than real boys or girls, that otaku culture promotes separating fiction and reality to avoid dangerous conflation. Some argue that regulating sexual expression in manga could cause greater harm than potential harm caused by such manga.</p>
					<p>However, some scholars and critics argue that lolicon can distort readers' sexual desires and induce crime, and that it violates the rights of children. Some non-profit organizations claim that lolicon works can be used for child grooming and engender a culture that is accepting of sexual abuse. The United Nations Human Rights Committee encouraged including explicit drawings of fictional children in laws against child pornography. Feminist critics argue that lolicon manga contributes to sexual violence by portraying girls passively and presenting the female body as the man's possession. Legal scholars argue that child pornography laws should not collapse reality and fiction together but should keep them separate. The debate over the legal status of lolicon works in Japan has created a discourse of Japanese exceptionalism to international norms.</p>
